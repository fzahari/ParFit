Required:

 * Python 3.6 or higher: 

If Python is not installed on your system, one can download 
the installation source from www.python.org. The website
contains detailed instructions on how to install. There are
pre-compiled binaries for selected systems. Python and most
of its libraries are open-source.

 * numpy, scipy, deap, and matplotlib Python libraries:

The easiest way to install ParFit and its dependencies is using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually:
    pip install numpy scipy deap matplotlib

You can check if the libraries are already installed on your system
by going into the interactive mode of Python (for example, by
typing "python3" at the prompt of a Linux/Unix system) and attempting
"import numpy", "import scipy", "import deap", and "import matplotlib".

 * "Engine":

The BSD licensed Mengine software from www.serenasoft.com has 
to be installed. The Mengine source code is located in the ParFit/Mengine directory.
Update the variable engine_path = “” in the file: ParFit/_Engine.py to the location of
the MM ENGINE executable file.

Optional:

 * matplotlib Python library:

Matplotlib is a nice plotting facility within Python that is quite handy for
a visual comparison of target and fitted curves. One can check if it
is already available by "import matplotlib". The website for installation
is matlplotlib.org.
